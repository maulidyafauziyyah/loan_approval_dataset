# Objectives

This project is created to evaluate the understanding of the Machine Learning concepts as follows:

- Ability to comprehend the overall concept of Machine Learning.
- Ability to prepare data for use in Supervised Learning models (Classification or Regression).
- Ability to implement Supervised Learning (Classification or Regression) with selected data.
- Ability to perform Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Improvement.
- Ability to perform Model Deployment.

## Instructions

This project is to be conducted in a notebook format and includes Model Deployment with several criteria outlined below:

1. The machine learning framework used is Scikit-Learn.

2. The use of visualization libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and others.

3. The project content follows the outlined structure below:
   1. Introduction
      > The introduction section contains the dataset background.
   
   2. Import Libraries
      > The first cell in the notebook contains all the libraries used in the project.
   
   3. Data Loading
      > This section includes the data preparation process before further data exploration. The Data Loading process may involve renaming columns, checking the dataset size, etc.
   
   4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      > This section contains data exploration using queries, grouping, simple visualization, and other exploratory methods.
   
   5. Feature Engineering
      > This section involves preparing data for the model training process, such as data splitting into train-test sets, data transformation (normalization, encoding, etc.), and other necessary processes.
   
   6. Model Definition
      > This section contains cells to define the model.
   
   7. Model Training
      > Cells in this section only contain code for model training and the resulting output.
   
   8. Model Evaluation
      > In this section, the model is evaluated based on selected metrics.
   
   9. Model Saving
      > This section involves saving the trained model and other related files.
   
   10. Model Inference
       > The trained model is tested on data not included in the train or test set.
   
   11. Conclusion
       > The final section includes conclusions reflecting the obtained results.
